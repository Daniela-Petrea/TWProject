        Create a Web tool for flexible visualization of data on actor
        nominations for the last years at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards
        via its own developed REST / GraphQL API. Additional information on each
        actor and film production can be accessed from The Movie Database
        (TMDb). The statistics and views generated - at least 3 ways - can be
        exported in CSV, WebP and SVG formats. The system will also provide
        support for the news access regarding each nominee, based on external
        data sources configurable within the developed application.

          -Our site is protected by sql injection, as it does not allow the
          alteration or deletion of data from databases using urls. In the case
          of both the nomination page and the statistics page, the filtering
          takes place on the front, and the user can select the filtering
          criterion by pressing a button and therefore cannot modify the url
          according to his own choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          -We also took measures to ensure protection against cross site
          scripting attacks. All instances of innerHTML have been modified to
          innerText to avoid rendering malicious scripts. Most of the website
          interaction is based on predefined filters, this way we avoided
          information completed by the user that could be rendered in the form
          of innerHTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          -Additionally, we used Zed Attack Proxy in order to find and scan
          potential vulnerabilities. The following were tested by ZAP security
          software:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>SQL injection</li>
          <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</li>
          <li>Broken access control</li>
          <li>Security miss-configuration</li>
          <li>Broken authentication</li>
          <li>Sensitive data exposure</li>
          <li>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</li>
          <li>Using components with known vulnerabilities.</li>

      <p>
        Tasks have been assigned so that all team members work equally hard.
        Initially we set the design, the color palette and what the interface
        should look like in the user interaction with the website. Github was
        chosen as the source code management system, where there were many
        commits given the division of the application into many submodules and
        tasks.
